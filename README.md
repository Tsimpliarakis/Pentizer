# Pentizer
Transform your boring distro into a hacking powerhouse.

Pentizer is a personal project that imports Kali and Parrot repositories in any Debian based distribution.
Adding other distro's repos is not the recomended way of getting the tools you need, but it's a fast and easy method, made faster and easier with Pentizer.

- Installation 

Run the pentizer.py file with root privileges and python3.
e.g. "sudo python3 pentizer.py"

- IMPORTANT
