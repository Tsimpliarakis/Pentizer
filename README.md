# Pentizer
Transform your boring distro into a hacking powerhouse.

Pentizer is a personal project that imports Kali and Parrot repositories in any Debian based distribution.
Adding other distro's repos is not the recomended way of getting the tools you need, but it's a fast and easy method, made faster and easier with Pentizer.

I'm not responsible for any broken systems. Use at your own risk.
Feel free to fork and help me improve the project.
